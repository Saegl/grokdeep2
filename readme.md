- Chapter 1 - Complete
Deep learning is the most valuable skill you can get in 21 century.
All you need is python and high school math.
Deep learning is the automation of intelligence and creativity.

- Chapter 2 - Complete
There are Supervised and Unsupervised dl:

Supervised means you have labeled data, you want to learn pattern from it and 
construct function that maps data to labels.

Unsupervised means you have just data, and you want to group it into clusters.


There are parametric and nonparametric dl:

Parametric means you have fixed model (fixed number of parameters), you adjust them 
during learning, but the number of parameters stays the same.

Nonparametric means, number of parameters will grow with with the dataset size.

- Chapter 3 - Complete (except numpy primer)
It was a chapter about forward propagation, in a different types of neural network -
One input to one output,
one input to multi output, 
multi input to one output,
multi input to multi output.
This chapter introduces vector and matrix, their operations (elementwise and dot product).
It has code for pure python and numpy implementations
